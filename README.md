Techtronix Innovations, a leading microchip and robotics company, faces critical challenges in optimizing its sales strategies, production planning, and market expansion despite a diverse product portfolio serving the automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial sectors.  The company's primary hurdles include unpredictable demand, inefficient inventory management, and difficulty identifying profitable market opportunities.

To address these challenges, Techtronix has amassed a comprehensive dataset of all transactions over the past year, including sales data, customer interactions, product details, and financial metrics. This rich data repository offers a significant opportunity for in-depth analysis and strategic decision-making.

This case study focuses on leveraging this dataset to develop an automated Power BI report that will guide Techtronix in overcoming its current obstacles. The analysis will target five key areas:

Sales Performance Analysis:  Identifying sales trends across product categories, sectors, regions, and timeframes, highlighting top and bottom performers. Customer Insights: Segmenting customers to reveal purchase patterns, sector-specific preferences, and geographic distribution, pinpointing the most valuable sectors for sales and profitability. Inventory Optimization: Comparing inventory management against sales data to identify production planning mismatches and recommending strategies to better align production with market demand. Profitability Analysis: Evaluating profitability across product categories, considering sales revenue and production costs, highlighting high-margin products, and suggesting cost reduction strategies. Market Expansion Opportunities: Analyzing sales and customer data to uncover new market opportunities, focusing on regions and sectors with untapped potential.

The deliverables for this case study include a comprehensive Power BI report with a dashboard summarizing key findings on sales performance, customer insights, and profitability, along with a PowerPoint presentation detailing the analysis, insights, and strategic recommendations for Techtronix Innovations.
